This code allows you to play double trouble against a CPU.
You have the option to go first or ask the computer to go 
first. Between turns it displays the new updated board
in the terminal window. You have the option to input
what color and the number of pieces you would like to 
remove. After the game is over it states who wins, the
player or the CPU.

The game of NIM is a two-player mathematical strategy game where players take turns 
removing a specific number of objects (usually sticks or stones) from distinct piles. 
The game is typically played with a set of piles, and each player can take any number 
of objects from one pile during their turn. The objective is to force the opponent to 
make the last move and take the last object. The game has variations, and its optimal 
winning strategy has been mathematically analyzed.

The game of NIM was solved by Charles Bouton, an American mathematician, in 1901. He 
established the winning strategy for the game using a mathematical approach known as 
"Nimbers" or Grundy numbers. This strategy, known as Bouton's Theorem, allows players 
to determine the winning moves and secure victory if played correctly.

The game of NIM made an appearance in the movie Alain Resnais' film Last Year at 
Marienbad.

NIM's simplicity, combined with its intriguing mathematical properties, has made it 
a classic and timeless game that continues to capture the interest of people in 
various forms of media and entertainment.
